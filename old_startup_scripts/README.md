# README.md

An opinionated startup script I use.

1. Modify `ubuntu-root-first-startup.sh` to change the username you wanna use.

2. Add your public keys to `authorized_keys`

3. Run `ubuntu-root-first-startup.sh` as root

4. Log back in as your user, and run `ubuntu-user-first-startup.sh`

I never tested these out!
